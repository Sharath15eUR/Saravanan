In computer networks, when two subnets are connected through different routers, communication fails at first due to the absence of routing information.

The Routing Table can be updated in two ways:

Method 1: Through the Configuration Tab:

The routerâ€™s configuration section allows adding the Network ID, Subnet Mask, and Next Hop IP address manually.

Method 2: Using the Router's CLI (Command Line Interface):

The ip route command is used to manually add the route to the destination network.
Syntax:ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.2
The successful connection between devices can be verified using tracert and ping commands after updating the routing table.
