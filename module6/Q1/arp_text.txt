ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. 
It is a communication protocol used to map an IP address (Layer 3 - Network Layer) to a MAC address 
(Layer 2 - Data Link Layer) within a local network.
When a device wants to send data packets to another device within the same network, 
it knows the IP address of the destination device but doesn't know the MAC address. 
Since data frames in the Ethernet network use MAC addresses for communication, 
ARP is used to resolve the IP address to the corresponding MAC address.
IMPORTANCE OF ARP IN PACKET FORWARDING:
ARP resolves the IP address to the corresponding MAC address, enabling devices to communicate within the same network.

When a packet needs to be forwarded to a device in a different network, ARP helps in finding the MAC address of the gateway or router, allowing smooth packet transmission.

By maintaining an IP-MAC mapping table, ARP helps in diagnosing and troubleshooting network connectivity issues efficiently.
