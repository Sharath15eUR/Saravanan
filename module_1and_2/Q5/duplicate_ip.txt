When two devices on the same network are assigned the same IP address, it creates an IP conflict. This leads to the following issues:

Network Instability – Both devices may randomly drop connections.
Packet Loss – Data packets may go to the wrong device or get lost.
MAC Address Flapping – The network switch alternates between two MAC addresses for the same IP.
ARP Conflicts – Devices will continuously send ARP requests to resolve the correct MAC address.
Security Risks – An attacker can intentionally configure a duplicate IP for a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
