## 2.Role of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6 and How It Improves Network Efficiency

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a foundational technology introduced in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) to significantly enhance network efficiency and performance. Unlike earlier Wi-Fi generations that used Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), where a single user occupied an entire channel, OFDMA enables multiple users to transmit and receive data simultaneously within the same channel. This dramatically reduces latency and increases overall throughput.
For example, if three devices require small data transmissions, an OFDMA-enabled access point (AP) can allocate separate RUs to all three devices and serve them simultaneously. In contrast, Wi-Fi 5 would have transmitted to each device sequentially, resulting in increased delays. Additionally, OFDMA enhances both downlink and uplink communication by enabling the AP to coordinate uplink transmissions, reducing collisions and contention among multiple devices attempting to transmit at the same time.

#### The adoption of OFDMA results in several benefits:
 higher network capacity, lower latency ideal for real-time applications like video conferencing and gaming, and improved battery efficiency for devices, as they spend less time awake and transmitting. Overall, OFDMA transforms Wi-Fi 6 networks into more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly systems.


## 3. Benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 for IoT Devices

Target Wake Time (TWT) is a key feature introduced in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) aimed at improving power efficiency and optimizing communication schedules, especially beneficial for IoT devices.

## Traditional Wi-Fi Challenges

- Devices stay awake longer, continuously checking for data transmission or reception.
- This leads to unnecessary battery consumption, particularly problematic for battery-powered IoT and mobile devices.

## How TWT Solves This

- **Scheduled Wake Times**: With TWT, devices sleep most of the time and wake up only at pre-negotiated, scheduled intervals.
- **Reduced Battery Usage**: By minimizing the time devices remain active, TWT significantly extends battery life.
- **Optimized Communication**: TWT allows the Access Point (AP) and client (station, STA) to agree on specific times for data exchange, avoiding constant polling.

## Working of TWT

1. The station (STA) sends a TWT Request to the Access Point (AP), proposing wake intervals.
2. The AP responds with a TWT Agreement, confirming the schedule.
3. The STA then sleeps and wakes up only at the agreed times for communication.

## Why TWT is Ideal for IoT Devices

- **Energy Efficiency**: Greatly enhances battery longevity for IoT devices such as sensors, wearables, and smart home appliances.
- **Less Network Congestion**: Reduces unnecessary channel contention by limiting the number of awake devices at any given time.
- **Improved Scalability**: Makes it feasible to support a large number of IoT devices within a network without degrading performance.

Overall, TWT is a crucial enhancement in Wi-Fi 6 that ensures efficient power management and reliable communication for modern IoT ecosystems.

## 7.	Explain the concept of Multi-Link Operation (MLO) and its impact on throughput and latency. 
It allows Wi-Fi devices to use multiple frequency bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) simultaneously, offering numerous advantages in performance, reliability, and efficiency. 
	Wi-Fi devices operate on a single link within one band at any given time. With MLO, devices can establish multiple links concurrently, which are used to transmit and receive data in parallel.  
This dramatically improves overall throughput since more spectrum is utilized at once.  
	MLO enhances reliability and reduces latency. If one frequency band becomes congested or experiences interference, the device can seamlessly shift more traffic to the other available links without dropping the connection.  
	MLO supports load balancing, where traffic is intelligently distributed across multiple links based on congestion and performance metrics.  
	It also provides redundancy, ensuring that even if one link fails, others can maintain uninterrupted connectivity. 
	The significant impact of MLO is on throughput. By transmitting data across multiple channels simultaneously, MLO effectively increases the total available bandwidth, boosting data rates.

### 9. Explain the concept of Fast BSS Transition (802.11r) and its benefit in mobile environments. 
•	The Fast BSS Transition (FT), defined under the IEEE 802.11r amendment, is a wireless networking feature that significantly improves the efficiency of roaming between access points (APs) within the same extended service set (ESS).  
•	It is designed to minimize the time required for a mobile device to transition (roam) from one AP to another, which is particularly important in environments where users are frequently moving, such as hospitals, airports, campuses, and industrial facilities. 
•	In a Wi-Fi network, a Basic Service Set (BSS) refers to an individual AP and its associated clients. When a client moves out of the range of one AP, it must roam to another AP in the same network (ESS).  
•	During this roaming process, several steps are involved: discovering new APs, authenticating with the new AP, and establishing a secure session using key exchanges.  
•	In traditional Wi-Fi standards before 802.11r, this entire process could take hundreds of milliseconds, which introduces noticeable delays and service interruptions— especially problematic for real-time applications like voice over Wi-Fi (VoWiFi), video calls, or online gaming. 
•	The 802.11r standard solves this delay by introducing the concept of Fast BSS Transition (FT). It allows the secure handover of clients between APs by preauthenticating and pre-associating with neighbouring APs before the actual transition happens. 
•	There are two primary methods that 802.11r supports: 
1.	Over-the-Air FT – The client authenticates directly with the target AP as part of the handoff process. 
2.	Over-the-DS FT – The client communicates with the target AP through the current AP using the distribution system (DS), such as a wired Ethernet backbone. 
 

### 10. How do 802.11k/v/r work together to provide seamless roaming in enterprise networks? 
802.11k, 802.11v, and 802.11r are IEEE standards that work together to enable seamless roaming in enterprise Wi-Fi networks by optimizing client transitions between access points (APs).  
 
 
#### 1.	802.11k (Radio Resource Measurement) – Neighbour Reports & Load Balancing 
•	Purpose: Helps clients make faster roaming decisions by providing visibility into nearby APs. 
•	How it works: APs send Neighbour Reports to clients, listing nearby APs (BSSIDs, channels, capabilities). Clients use this info to pre-scan potential roaming targets instead of performing full channel scans. Enables load balancing by steering clients to less congested APs. 
•	Role in roaming: Reduces discovery time, enabling quicker handoffs. 
 
#### 2.	802.11v (Wireless Network Management) – BSS Transition & Power Save 
•	Purpose: Allows APs to guide clients for better roaming decisions. 
•	How it works: APs send BSS Transition Management Requests to suggest or force a client to roam (e.g., due to poor signal or congestion). Supports 802.11v Sleep Mode, improving battery life for mobile devices. Provides network-assisted roaming by sharing metrics like signal strength and traffic load. 
•	Role in roaming: Ensures clients move at the optimal time, avoiding sticky client issues. 
 
#### 3.	802.11r (Fast BSS Transition – FT) – Faster Authentication 
•	Purpose: Reduces reauthentication delays during roaming. 
•	How it works: Enables pre-authentication and key caching between APs in the same mobility domain. Uses Fast Transition (FT) mechanisms (Over-the-Air or Over-theDS) to skip full 802.1X authentication. Reduces handoff time from ~200-500ms to <50ms, critical for VoIP and real-time apps. 
•	Role in roaming: Eliminates delays caused by reauthentication. 
 
In enterprise Wi-Fi networks, 802.11k, 802.11v, and 802.11r work together to enable seamless roaming by optimizing each stage of the handoff process. When a client device moves through the network, 802.11k provides neighbour reports to quickly identify nearby APs, eliminating the need for time-consuming full channel scans. 802.11v enhances this by allowing the network to intelligently influence roaming decisions, ensuring clients switch APs at the optimal time—before signal degradation or congestion impacts performance.  
Finally, 802.11r streamlines the re-association process with fast BSS transition (FT), reducing authentication delays from hundreds of milliseconds to near-instantaneous handoffs. The result is faster, smoother roaming with minimal packet loss—critical for real-time applications like VoIP and video conferencing.
