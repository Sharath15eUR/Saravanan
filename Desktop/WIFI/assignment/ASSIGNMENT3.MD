## 1. What are the different 802.11 PHY layer standards? Compare their characteristics.
The IEEE 802.11 standard includes several physical layer (PHY) specifications that define how data is transmitted over wireless networks. Each version improves performance, range, and efficiency in different scenarios.

802.11a: 5 GHz, up to 54 Mbps, uses OFDM, less congestion, shorter range.

802.11b: 2.4 GHz, 11 Mbps, DSSS, good range, more interference.

802.11g: 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps, OFDM, backward compatible with b.

802.11n: 2.4/5 GHz, up to 600 Mbps, MIMO 

802.11ac: 5 GHz, up to 6.9 Gbps, MU-MIMO, beamforming, 160 MHz.

802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E): 2.4/5/6 GHz, up to 9.6 Gbps, OFDMA, BSS Coloring, better MU-MIMO.
## 2.	What are DSSS and FHSS? How do they work? 
DSSS: 
             
DSSS works by spreading the original data signal over a wider frequency band using a pseudo-random code called a chipping code. Each bit of data is represented by multiple chips, which makes the signal more resistant to noise and interference. Even if parts of the signal are lost or corrupted, the receiver can still reconstruct the original data using the known spreading code. DSSS is used in IEEE 802.11b and offers good data integrity and resistance to jamming. 

FHSS: 

 FHSS works by rapidly switching (hopping) the carrier frequency over a wide range of channels in a pseudo-random sequence. Both the transmitter and receiver follow the same hopping pattern, allowing them to stay synchronized. If interference occurs at one frequency, the system quickly moves to another, reducing the chance of signal degradation. FHSS was used in early wireless technologies like Bluetooth and early 802.11 versions. 
DSSS spreads the data over a wide band continuously, while FHSS transmits the data over different frequencies at different times, both improving communication reliability and resistance to interference. 
## 3.	How do Modulation Schemes Work in the PHY Layer? 
Modulation is the process of changing a carrier signal (a high-frequency waveform) to encode digital information (bits) for wireless transmission. This allows binary data (0s and 1s) to be sent over the air efficiently.In Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), modulation is used at the PHY (Physical) Layer to transmit bits from the source to the destination using electromagnetic waves.
Carrier Wave:
A constant-frequency wave (like a sine wave) is the base signal.

Digital Data:
Binary data from higher layers (e.g., 1101) is fed into the PHY layer.The PHY layer modifies the carrier wave’s characteristics – such as amplitude, frequency, or phase – based on the binary input.Each pattern of bits is assigned to a symbol.One symbol can represent 1, 2, 4, 6, or more bits, depending on the modulation scheme.

Transmission:
The modulated carrier signal is sent over the air.

Reception & Demodulation:

The receiver’s PHY layer interprets the received wave by demodulating it back into the original bit stream.

Accurate demodulation depends on signal quality (SNR).

| Modulation   | Bits per Symbol | Data Rate   | Noise Resistance | Bandwidth Efficiency | Used In                   |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **BPSK**     | 1                | Low         | Very High        | Low                  | 802.11b, 802.11a           |
| **QPSK**     | 2                | Medium      | High             | Medium               | 802.11a/g/n                |
| **16-QAM**   | 4                | Higher      | Moderate         | High                 | 802.11n, 802.11ac          |
| **64-QAM**   | 6                | High        | Lower            | Very High            | 802.11n, 802.11ac          |
| **256-QAM**  | 8                | Very High   | Sensitive        | Excellent            | 802.11ac                   |
| **1024-QAM** | 10               | Ultra High  | Very Sensitive   | Best                 | 802.11ax (Wi-Fi6)         |

802.11b uses BPSK and QPSK (with DSSS), offering low speeds (up to 11 Mbps) but high reliability. 	802.11a/g use BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM with OFDM, achieving up to 54 Mbps. 
802.11n expands on previous modulation with MIMO and 64-QAM to reach up to 600 Mbps. 
802.11ac introduces 256-QAM and wider channels, allowing up to several Gbps. 
802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E) uses up to 1024-QAM or even 4096-QAM with OFDMA and MU-MIMO for efficient, high-throughput communication in dense environments. 

## 4.	What is the Significance of OFDM in WLAN? How Does It Improve Performance?
 OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) is a digital modulation technique that divides a high-speed data stream into multiple lower-speed sub-streams and transmits them simultaneously over several closely spaced, orthogonal subcarriers. Each subcarrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (like BPSK, QPSK, or QAM). 
These subcarriers are mathematically orthogonal to each other, meaning they can overlap in frequency without interfering with each other, thus maximizing spectral efficiency. 

The significance  and performance of the OFDM Techniques are
 
1. High Data Rates	-Parallel subcarriers increase total bandwidth efficiency.
2. Interference Resistance-	Slower subcarriers are less affected by narrowband interference.
3. Multipath Handling-	Reduces Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) caused by signal reflections indoors.
4. Spectral Efficiency-	Subcarriers overlap but don’t interfere, making better use of limited spectrum.
5. Scalability	-Can adjust subcarrier spacing, number of carriers, and modulation schemes.
6. Adaptive Modulation Support	-Each subcarrier can use different modulations based on channel quality.

## 5.How Are Frequency Bands Divided for Wi-Fi? Explain Different Bands and Their Channel

### 2.4 GHz Band: 

•	Range: 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz 
•	Total Channels: 14 channels (each 20 MHz wide, but only 1–13 are commonly used globally) 
•	Channel Spacing: 5 MHz apart, leading to overlap between adjacent channels 
•	Non-overlapping Channels: Only 3 non-overlapping channels — 1, 6, and 11 — are commonly used to reduce interference 
•	Use Case: Longer range, better wall penetration, but more interference from devices like Bluetooth, microwaves, etc. 

### 	5 GHz Band: 

•	Range: 5.150 GHz to 5.825 GHz (varies by country and regulatory domain) 
•	Total Channels: Over 20 channels, including UNII-1, UNII-2, UNII-2 Extended, and 
UNII-3 ranges 
•	Channel Widths: Supports 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz channels for higher throughput 
•	Less Congestion: More non-overlapping channels and less interference make it suitable for high-performance applications 
•	DFS : Some channels require DFS to avoid interference with radar systems 

### 6 GHz Band (Wi-Fi 6E): 

•	Range: 5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz 
•	Total Channels: Up to 59 new 20 MHz channels, or 14+ channels at 80/160 MHz widths • No Legacy Devices: Only accessible by Wi-Fi 6E devices 
•	Benefits: Ideal for ultra-high-speed connections, VR, 4K/8K streaming, and enterprise environments 

## 6. What is the role of Guard Intervals in WLAN transmission? How does a short Guard Interval improve efficiency? 


In WLAN transmission, the Guard Interval (GI) is a short period of time inserted between transmitted symbols to prevent signal interference caused by multipath effects, and a shorter GI can improve efficiency by allowing for faster symbol transmission and higher throughput.It ensures clear separation between OFDM symbols.
 It provides time for delayed echoes (reflected signals) to die out before the next symbol starts.
 It makes the system more robust in environments with multipath, such as indoor Wi-Fi zones with walls and furniture
 #### IMPORVE EFFICIENCY
 A shorter guard interval reduces overhead, allowing more data to be transmitted per second, which improves throughput—but only in low-interference environments. It's a smart trade-off between speed and reliability, used in modern Wi-Fi like 802.11n/ac/ax.e.

## 7.	Describe the structure of an 802.11 PHY layer frame. What are its key components?

1.	Preamble: 

•	Used for synchronization, channel estimation, and timing alignment.
